# 1. *As a user, I want to be able to see and move around as John Smith, so that I can play the game as John Smith.*

### Elaboration: 
The user should have the ability to move around as John Smith in the game, so we need to learn how to make an object move aorund in Unity, and then replace the object with the John Smith sprite and animations. 

### Constraints: 
none

### Effort Estimation:
6 person-hours

### Acceptance Test: 
- Be able to move left and right as John Smith
- Be able to jump as John Smith
- Sprites/Animations are in sync with what is happening (ie. turns left when switching running direction from right and vice-versa, jump action is synced with jump animation, etc...).
