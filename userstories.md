# 1. *As a user, I want to be able to see and move around as John Smith, so that I can play the game as John Smith.*

### Elaboration: 
The user should have the ability to move around as John Smith in the game, so we need to learn how to make an object move aorund in Unity, and then replace the object with the John Smith sprite and animations. 

### Constraints: 
none

### Effort Estimation:
6 person-hours

### Acceptance Test: 
- Be able to move left and right as John Smith
- Be able to jump as John Smith
- Sprites/Animations are in sync with what is happening (ie. turns left when switching running direction from right and vice-versa, jump action is synced with jump animation, etc...).


# 2. *As a user, I want the camera to follow John Smith, so that I can further explore the level.*

### Elaboration:
The user, playing as John Smith, should be able to see John Smith on screen at all times, so we need to find out how/and then implement this componenent. 

### Constraints:
none

### Effort Estimation:
2 person-hours

## Acceptance Test:
- As you move around as John Smith on the screen, the camera must follow John Smith, and keep him centered at all times.


# 3. *As a user, I want to be able to fight enemies as John Smith, so that I make progress through the level.*

### Elaboration:

### Constraints:

### Effort Estimation:

### Acceptance Test:
