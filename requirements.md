# Requirements Specification for *John Smith*

## Introduction:

John Smith is a 2d platformer that tells the story about a man named John Smith who has found himself trapped in a video game. In this endeavor, he finds himself having to fight off enemies who are trying to keep him in the game world. Brussels Sprouts, the IRS, paperwork, are a few mentionable enemies that he encounters. This requirements specification is will describe what John Smith will do and how it will perform. We, here at Not A Team, hope that you find it helpful. 


### 1.2 Scope of Product

In *John Smith*, you will play as John Smith. This includes being able to jump, run, wall jump, and use weapons. These abilities are needed to be able to get through the levels, which include enemies, obstacles, and traps. The player will be able to see their lives, collectables, weapon status, and other information necessary on the screen. 

  
### 1.3 Acronyms, Abbreviations, Definitions 

2d: two dimensions. (Think of just the x-y plane ie. Cartesian plane, or a flat surface) 

Platformer: a game in which you jump platform to platform using a character. 

C#: a programming language. 


## General Description of Product 

We have never made a video game before, so it is hard to promise things that we are not sure we can keep. But we do like hypotheticals. 

*John Smith* will have many playable levels. These levels are the jungle, an office building, the desert, and whatever else wacky level we can think of. The main one that we will focus on is the office building. These levels will be full of obstacles, traps, and enemies that John Smith (you) will have to navigate (or slash) through. As John Smith, you will be able to stomp on enenmies, who will be programmed to kill John Smith/hinder him on his journey through the level.
  
### 2.1 Context of Product 

We will build the game using the Unity platform. We will use Audacity to record the voice of John Smith. We will use Adobe to create artwork for the game, including sprites and user interfaces.  


### 2.2 Domain Model with Description 

Our domain model will start with our ideas and then learn and implement the syntax.  Next, we will then put the program together, then start testing our game for any bugs. 

Once our bugs have been fixed and our software is fully operational, we will be finished. 


### 2.4 User Characteristics and Expectations 

Our users are anyone who can use the arrow keys, but really, anyone who is interested in 2D platformers. 

 
### 2.5 Constraints 

I feel the constraints will mostly be limited to the operating system we chose.  As well as the computer architectures we choose and the minimum requirements we will require to build and play this software game. 


### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies 

Our systems depend on Unity. The system should be able to run Unity. 


## Functional Requirements 

Functional requirements we will meet are that the player be able to engage in gameplay along with interacting with the game world and its content. 

Players shall also be able to save their progress in the game, this is also a functional requirement that will be met.

## System and Non-functional Requirements 

Non-functional requirements for our software will be its reliability, security, usability and especially interoperability and compatibility. 


### 4.1 External Interface Requirements (User,Hardware,Software,Communications) 

The user should have a Microsoft Windows 10 operating system. Most hardware should be able to run our program. 


### 4.2 Performance Requirements 

Our product's performance needs will be low pertaining to hardware and operating systems. However, the game's interface will be more specific about the performance requirements needed. 


### 4.3 Design Constraints 

Our design constraints will be using one type of IDE and Unity to make our game.  Another constraint is that we will be developing our game 

and a windows OS machine. In the beginning stages, we are following a tutorial on YouTube to get our footing and learn how to incorporate all the different assets. 

  
### 4.4 Quality Requirements 

Our quality requirements will be functional suitability, completeness, and appropriateness.  Reliability and performance efficiency are also  

our quality requirements.
