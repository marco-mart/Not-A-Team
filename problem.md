## General Description of Product

We have never made a video game before, so it is hard to promise things that we are not sure we can keep. But, I do like hypotheticals.

*John Smith* will have many playable levels. These levels are: the jungle, an office building, the desert, and whatever else wacky level we can think of. The main one that we will focus on is the office building. These levels will be full of obstacles, traps, and enemies that John Smith (you) will have to navigate (or slash) through.
