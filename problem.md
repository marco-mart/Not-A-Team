## General Description of Product

We have never made a video game before, so it is hard to promise things that we are not sure we can keep. But, I do like hypotheticals.

*John Smith* will have many playable levels. These levels are: the jungle, an office building, the desert, and whatever else wacky level we can think of. The main one that we will focus on is the office building. These levels will be full of obstacles, traps, and enemies that John Smith (you) will have to navigate (or slash) through.

**Basic overview of the capabilities of your product. This is not your list of functional requirements, but an overview. Part of your problem statement might be good here.**

### 2.4 User Characteristics and Expectations

Our users are anyone who can use the arrow keys, but really, anyone who is interested in our product.
**Describe your users and their abilities.**

### 2.5 Constraints
I feel the constraings will mostly be limited to the operating system we chose.  As well as the computer architectures we choose and the minimum requirements we will reguire
to build and play this software game.
**Describe any constraints on your system.**

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

Our systems depends on Unity. The system should be able to run Unity.
**Does your system depend on external software packages? System assumptions? If so, describe them.**

## Functional Requirements

**In a standard requirements document, you would have a LONG list of functional requirements here. You should put a link to your user story page here.**

## System and Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requiremtns for our software will be its reliablility, security, usability and especially interoperablity and compatibility.
### 4.1 External Interface Requirements (User,Hardware,Software,Communications)
The user should have a Microfsoft Windows 10 operating system. Most hardware should be able to run our program.
**Describe what kinds of interfaces your product has, and what they do. Then list specific requirements using item numbers as NF.4.1.X.**

### 4.2 Performance Requirements
Our product's performance needs will be low pertaining to hardware and operating systems.  However the game's interface will be more specific
about the performance requirements needed.
**Describe your product's performance needs. Then list specific requirements using item numbers as NF.4.2.X.**

### 4.3 Design Constraints
Our design constraints will be using one type of IDE and Unity to make our game.  Another constraint is that we will be developing our game
and a windows OS machine.
**Describe external requirements that will constrain your design choices. Then list specific requirements using item numbers as NF.4.3.X.**

### 4.4 Quality Requirements
Our quality requirements will be functional suitibilty, completeness, and appropriateness.  Reliability and performancce efficiency are also 
our quality requirements.
**What quality expectations do your users have? Is your system life-critical? Describe such issues, then list specific requirements using item numbers as NF.4.4.X.**

### 4.5 Other Requirements

**Anything else you need to say. Use item numbers NF.4.5.X.**
