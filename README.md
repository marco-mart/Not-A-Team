Working on: "John Smith", a 2-d platformer game. 

"John Smith" is a normal guy with a normal life. He has a wife, two kids, and a dog named Sport. He has a problem: he's stuck in a video game. Join John Smith as he fights his way through an office space, encountering enemies such as brussels sprouts, paperwork, the IRS, and more!
